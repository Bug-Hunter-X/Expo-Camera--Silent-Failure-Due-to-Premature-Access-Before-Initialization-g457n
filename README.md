# Expo Camera Initialization Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug when using the Expo Camera API. The issue arises from attempting to access camera features before the camera has fully initialized. This often results in unexpected behavior, crashes, or silent failures that can be difficult to debug.

## Problem

The Expo Camera API's asynchronous nature can lead to race conditions. If you try to use the camera before the `onCameraReady` callback or similar initialization event fires, your application might fail silently, leading to unpredictable results.

## Solution

The core solution is to always ensure you only access camera features *after* receiving confirmation that the camera is ready.  This involves structuring your code to wait for the appropriate asynchronous event before proceeding.
